# xano-community-cli

**_(Work In Progress)_**

---

**A tool to improve dev experience with XANO, especially for teams where clarity, transparency, and version control is important. Furthermore, this cli should help automate currently manual apsects of XANO. Why a CLI when we have AI? I am bullish on the AI, but in all honesty using AI so much without proper human control can cause a lot of issues. The idea behind this CLI is to reduce the need of reliance on AI and that we have our most crucial parts (version control, documentation, testing, code-generation, opinionated rules, etc.) in place in any case, environment, system, either in part of a git provider or local system. The goal is to make it flexible and if there's need, then obiously LLM-ready.**

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies _(use npm or pnpm)_
    ```
    pnpm install
    ```
3. Build the CLI
    ```
    pnpm build
    ```
4. **Run the CLI:**
    - Using pnpm (recommended):
      ```
      pnpm exec xcc --help
      ```
    - Or using npx:
      ```
      npx xcc --help
      ```

5. _(Optional)_ If you want the CLI globally available during development:
    ```
    pnpm link
    ```
    > **Note:** If you use `pnpm link`, remember to `pnpm unlink --global` when done to avoid version confusion.

6. See the [documentation](/docs/README.md) for available commands and arguments.

## ü§ñ Using in GitHub Actions

You can use this CLI as a GitHub Action to automate your Xano workflows.

Here is an example job that checks out your repository and uses the local composite action (`./dist/actions/master-action.yml`), which in turn securely downloads and runs the XCC CLI as npm package via the npx command.

```yaml
jobs:
  sync:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 1. Setup Node.js and authenticate to the npm registry
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          registry-url: 'https://registry.npmjs.org' # This is the default, but being explicit is good practice

      # 2. Use the Xano CLI Action from your repository
      # This composite action handles setup and (multiple or single) command execution by calling the published npm package.
      - name: Run Xano Commands
        uses: ./dist/actions/master-action.yml
        with:
          # Xano Instance name, used to identify the created configuration during command execution
          instance-name: 'production'
          instance-url: ${{ secrets.XANO_URL }}
          # Xano Metadata API token. Make sure to set it up as a secret
          api-token: ${{ secrets.XANO_API_TOKEN }}
          version: 'latest' # or a specific version like '0.1.1'
          # You can specify multiple commands in new lines and the action will execute them in order.
          # See the [documentation](/docs/README.md) for command docs.
          run: |
            generate-oas --all
```
