description: Plan a XanoScript feature or project implementation
mode: agent
---

Delegate to @xano-planner to create an implementation plan.

**Context to include:**
- Feature or project requirements
- Expected functionality and use cases
- Authentication/authorization needs
- Integration requirements (frontend, external APIs)

The planner will:
1. Explore the existing codebase
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Create a detailed implementation plan
4. Recommend which specialized agents to use

**Note:** The planner creates plans but does NOT write code. After planning, follow the handoff recommendations to the appropriate specialized agents.
